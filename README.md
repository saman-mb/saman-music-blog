# Elektron Guides

A comprehensive collection of how-to guides and workflows for Elektron instruments including Digitakt, Digitone, Analog Rytm, Octatrack, and more.

## 🎵 About

This documentation site contains step-by-step guides for various Elektron workflows, from basic sampling techniques on the Digitakt to advanced synthesis on the Digitone, complex sequencing on the Octatrack, and analog drum programming on the Analog Rytm. Whether you're creating UK Drill beats, jungle breakbeats, ambient soundscapes, or experimental electronic music, you'll find detailed tutorials to help you master your Elektron gear.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

The guides are organized by category and device, with tags for easy cross-referencing:

- **[Sampling](/docs/sampling/)** - Techniques for recording, editing, and managing samples (Digitakt, Octatrack)
- **[Beat Making](/docs/beat-making/)** - Drum programming and rhythm creation (all devices)
- **[Sound Design](/docs/sound-design/)** - Creating and manipulating sounds (Digitone, Analog series)
- **[Synthesis](/docs/synthesis/)** - FM synthesis techniques and sound programming (Digitone)
- **[Sequencing](/docs/sequencing/)** - Advanced sequencing techniques across all devices
- **[Effects & Processing](/docs/effects/)** - Using built-in effects and processing
- **[Project Management](/docs/project-management/)** - Organizing projects, patterns, and presets
- **[Performance](/docs/performance/)** - Live performance techniques and device integration
