# Saman's Music Research

A personal blog documenting my research into music production, gear analysis, sampling techniques, and electronic music workflows. Written by Saman, a software engineer and music enthusiast based in London.

## üéµ About

This site serves as my research journal where I document deep dives into music gear, production techniques, sampling research, and technical analysis of electronic music. From Elektron hardware workflows to obscure sample archaeology, I explore the intersection of technology and music creation.

## üìö Research Areas

My research covers several interconnected areas:

- **[Gear Analysis](/gear-analysis/)** - In-depth reviews and technical analysis of music hardware and software
- **[Sampling Research](/sampling-research/)** - Archaeological digs into sample sources, stem hunting, and remix research  
- **[Production Techniques](/production-techniques/)** - Workflow documentation and technique analysis across various genres
- **[Hardware Workflows](/hardware-workflows/)** - Device-specific guides and integration techniques
- **[Music Archaeology](/music-archaeology/)** - Research into classic tracks, their construction, and sample sources
