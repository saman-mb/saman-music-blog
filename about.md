<p>Hi, I'm Saman — a software engineer and music production enthusiast based in London. This site serves as my research journal where I document my deep dives into music gear, production techniques, sampling archaeology, and the technical aspects of electronic music creation.</p>

<p>Research suggests my work sits at the intersection of software engineering and music production. I document methods, gear analysis, and sampling archaeology — aiming to provide reproducible findings and practical workflows.</p>

<p>I research sampling sources, dissect hardware and software, and publish step-by-step methodologies for producers and researchers alike. This site is an ongoing research journal; expect detailed methodology, citations, and practical examples.</p>

## Background

My journey bridges technology and music: I'm a self-taught musician with a creative spirit who took an academic path through Music Informatics (BSc, 1st Class Hons), studying computer music, audio programming, and DSP. After graduating, I moved fully into software engineering, spending the last decade working across mobile and streaming platforms, low-latency audio systems, and large-scale SaaS products.

While my career is in software engineering, this blog intentionally focuses on music research — the production techniques, sampling archaeology, and creative workflows that inspire my practice. My engineering background gives me tools to analyze and reproduce sounds precisely, but the research here is driven by artistic curiosity first.

## Musical Background
w
My academic work in Music Informatics was centered at the intersection of technology and creative expression. My third-year dissertation project, "iChaOsc," was a cellular automaton-driven granular synthesizer for iPhone that explored algorithmic composition and novel sound design interfaces.

I've extensively worked with SuperCollider for synthesis, live coding performances, and experimenting with musical interfaces. This work allowed me to explore how technical implementation influences creative workflows and sound design possibilities. This confluence of programming and sound creation informs how I approach music production tools and sampling research today.

In my professional life, I've worked on audio streaming platforms and systems requiring precise timing and low-latency performance, which has deepened my understanding of the technical underpinnings of music technology.

## What I Research

**Gear Analysis**: I dive deep into music hardware and software, analysing how tools shape workflows and outcomes.

**Sampling Archaeology**: I hunt for stems, document sample sources, and explore ethical and legal aspects of sampling.

**Production Techniques**: From classic hardware setups to hybrid modern workflows, I document reproducible techniques and practical tips.

**Music Archaeology**: I investigate how classic tracks were made and how those techniques translate to today.

## Future Topics

Although this site emphasises music, I plan to publish occasional technical articles that are music-focused — for example on live coding, SuperCollider, and audio programming. These will be written with producers in mind and will aim to bridge creative practice and technical detail.

## Research Approach

My research methodology combines:

- **Technical Analysis**: Understanding the nuts and bolts of how gear works and how tracks are constructed
- **Historical Context**: Placing techniques and tools in their cultural and technological context
- **Practical Application**: Testing and documenting real-world workflows and techniques
- **Documentation**: Creating detailed, searchable records of findings for future reference

## Why I Share This Research

The music production community thrives on shared knowledge. By documenting my research publicly, I hope to:

- Contribute to the collective understanding of music production techniques
- Preserve knowledge about classic production methods and tools
- Help other producers make informed decisions about gear and techniques
- Build a searchable archive of production knowledge

## Contact
