# About Me

Hi, I'm **Saman** â€” a software engineer and music production enthusiast based in London. This site serves as my research journal where I document my deep dives into music gear, production techniques, sampling archaeology, and the technical aspects of electronic music creation.

## Background

My dual background in software engineering and music gives me a unique perspective on music technology. I'm fascinated by the intersection of technical innovation and creative expression, particularly in electronic music production.

### What I Research

**Gear Analysis**: I dive deep into music hardware and software, analyzing not just what they do, but how they shape creative workflows and musical outcomes.

**Sampling Archaeology**: I research the origins of samples in classic tracks, hunt for stems and isolated elements, and document the technical aspects of sampling culture.

**Production Techniques**: I study and document production workflows, from classic hardware setups to modern hybrid approaches.

**Music Archaeology**: I investigate how classic tracks were made, what tools and techniques were used, and how we can understand and recreate these approaches today.

## Research Approach

My research methodology combines:

- **Technical Analysis**: Understanding the nuts and bolts of how gear works and how tracks are constructed
- **Historical Context**: Placing techniques and tools in their cultural and technological context
- **Practical Application**: Testing and documenting real-world workflows and techniques
- **Documentation**: Creating detailed, searchable records of findings for future reference

## Why I Share This Research

The music production community thrives on shared knowledge. By documenting my research publicly, I hope to:

- Contribute to the collective understanding of music production techniques
- Preserve knowledge about classic production methods and tools
- Help other producers make informed decisions about gear and techniques
- Build a searchable archive of production knowledge

## Contact

Based in London, UK. You can follow my research updates through this site or connect with me about music production, gear, or sampling research.
