# FM Bass Programming on Digitone

Creating powerful FM bass sounds on the Elektron Digitone requires understanding the relationship between operators and how they modulate each other. This guide will walk you through creating classic FM bass tones as well as modern, aggressive bass sounds.

## Overview

The Digitone's FM synthesis engine provides four operators per voice, allowing for complex harmonic relationships. For bass programming, we'll focus on algorithms that emphasize fundamental frequencies while adding harmonic richness.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic FM synthesis principles for bass design
- Operator relationships and algorithm selection
- Envelope programming for bass dynamics
- Filter usage for tone shaping
- Pitch modulation for expressive bass lines

## Step 1: Understanding FM Bass Fundamentals

### Algorithm Selection

For bass sounds, algorithms 1, 2, and 8 work particularly well:

**Algorithm 1 (Stack)**
```
OP-A → OP-B → OP-C → OP-D → OUT
```
- Linear modulation chain
- Great for harmonic bass sounds
- Easy to control harmonic content

**Algorithm 2 (Parallel)**
```
OP-A → OUT
OP-B → OUT  
OP-C → OP-D → OUT
```
- Mix of fundamental and modulated harmonics
- Excellent for complex bass tones

## Step 2: Basic FM Bass Patch

### Initial Setup

1. **Select Algorithm 1**
   - Press `[SYNTH]` + `[TRIG 1]`
   - Navigate to `ALG` parameter
   - Set to `1`

2. **Configure Operator A (Carrier)**
   - Ratio: `1.00` (fundamental frequency)
   - Level: `100`
   - Attack: `0`
   - Decay: `50`
   - Sustain: `70`
   - Release: `30`

3. **Configure Operator B (Modulator)**
   - Ratio: `1.00` (unison modulation)
   - Level: `30-50` (adjust for harmonic content)
   - Envelope: Similar to OP-A but slightly faster

## Step 3: Adding Harmonic Character

### Operator Ratios for Different Bass Tones

**Sub Bass (Clean)**
- OP-A Ratio: `1.00`
- OP-B Ratio: `1.00`
- OP-B Level: `20-30`

**Electric Bass (Warm)**
- OP-A Ratio: `1.00`
- OP-B Ratio: `2.00`
- OP-B Level: `40-60`

**Aggressive Bass (Modern)**
- OP-A Ratio: `1.00`
- OP-B Ratio: `1.50`
- OP-B Level: `60-80`

## Step 4: Dynamic Control

### Envelope Programming

**Percussive Bass**
```
Attack: 0
Decay: 40-60
Sustain: 20-40
Release: 10-20
```

**Sustained Bass**
```
Attack: 5-10
Decay: 20-30
Sustain: 80-100
Release: 40-60
```

### Velocity Sensitivity

1. **Assign Level to Velocity**
   - Select operator
   - Press `[MOD]`
   - Set `VEL → LEV` to `50-80`

2. **Assign Filter to Velocity**
   - Press `[FILT]`
   - Set `VEL → FRQ` to `30-50`

## Step 5: Filter and Effects

### Filter Programming

**Low-Pass for Warmth**
- Type: `LP`
- Frequency: `60-80`
- Resonance: `10-20`
- Envelope: `20-40`

**High-Pass for Punch**
- Type: `HP`
- Frequency: `10-15`
- Resonance: `5-10`

### Essential Effects

**Compressor**
- Threshold: `70-80`
- Attack: `1-3`
- Release: `20-30`
- Gain: Adjust to taste

**Chorus (for width)**
- Speed: `20-30`
- Depth: `15-25`
- Feedback: `10-15`

## Step 6: Advanced Techniques

### Pitch Modulation

**LFO Setup for Wobble**
1. Press `[LFO]`
2. Set destination to `PITCH`
3. Speed: `30-60`
4. Depth: `5-15`
5. Waveform: `SIN` or `TRI`

### Operator Feedback

**Adding Grit**
1. Select Operator A
2. Increase `FB` parameter to `20-40`
3. Adjust Level to compensate

## Step 7: Performance Tips

### Live Playing Techniques

**Portamento for Slides**
- Enable `PORT`
- Set time to `10-30`
- Use for smooth bass slides

**Pitch Bend**
- Assign to `[PITCH]` wheel
- Range: `±2` semitones
- Perfect for expressive bass lines

### Sequencing Considerations

**Pattern Programming**
- Use parameter locks for tonal variation
- Lock different operator levels per step
- Vary filter frequency for movement

**Probability Settings**
- Add subtle variations with `%` parameter
- Use on secondary operators for evolving sound

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bass Too Quiet**
- Check operator levels
- Ensure Algorithm routing is correct
- Verify filter isn't cutting too much

**Too Much Harmonic Content**
- Reduce modulator levels
- Adjust operator ratios
- Use filter to tame harmonics

**Lacks Punch**
- Increase attack envelope speed
- Add slight pitch envelope
- Use compressor for consistency

## Conclusion

FM bass programming on the Digitone offers incredible sonic possibilities. Start with simple patches and gradually add complexity through operator relationships, modulation, and effects. Remember that small adjustments to ratios and levels can dramatically change the character of your bass sound.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with different algorithms
- Try more complex operator routings
- Combine with external effects
- Layer with Digitakt drum patterns for complete tracks
