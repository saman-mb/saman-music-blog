# Papua New Guinea by FSOL: Sample Archaeology and Stem Research

Research suggests that official, high-quality stems or individual samples for "Papua New Guinea" by Future Sound of London are not publicly available, though unofficial low-quality options exist and could support a remix with some effort. Evidence leans toward recreating elements using the track's known sampled sources as a viable alternative, given the song's sample-heavy construction.

## Executive Summary

**Key Challenges and Options**  
- **Limited Availability**: Searches across music databases, forums, and download sites indicate no authorized stem packs from FSOL or their labels, likely due to copyright considerations for a classic track.  
- **Unofficial Stems**: Low-quality (128kbps MP3) remix stems are accessible for free, but they're more like a collection of isolated elements rather than professional multitracks—useful for basic remixing but may require cleanup.  
- **Acapella and Isolated Elements**: A "stringsapella" (potentially combining strings and vocals) is available on acapella sites, again at lower quality, which could serve as a starting point for vocal-focused remixes.  
- **Recreation Potential**: The track relies heavily on publicly identifiable samples from other artists, making it feasible to source and layer those originals yourself for a custom remix, though this involves creative interpretation.  
- **Other Resources**: Isolated dub drums or remix versions on platforms like Bandcamp offer partial elements, but not full stems. MIDI files exist for sequencing, which might help rebuild the structure.

**Potential Starting Points**  
If you're open to low-quality or recreated options, begin with the unofficial stems from sites like Audioz.download (free via links like http://peeplink.in/fc1d564bb233) or the stringsapella from Acapellas4U (requires registration, enhanced access via optional donation). For higher fidelity, track down the original samples listed below and use tools like Audacity for extraction and editing. Always consider fair use or licensing for any commercial remix release.

**Legal Note**  
Remixing involves copyright—contact FSOL or their label (e.g., via Bandcamp) for permissions if planning public distribution. Unofficial downloads carry risks like quality issues or legality in some regions.

## In-Depth Exploration of Sources for "Papua New Guinea" Stems and Samples

"Papua New Guinea," released in 1991 by Future Sound of London (FSOL, consisting of Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans), remains an iconic electronic track blending breakbeat, ambient, and rave elements. Produced at their Earthbeat studio in Dollis Hill, London, it exemplifies early '90s sample-based music, drawing from diverse sources like ethnic vocals, basslines, and environmental sounds. As a music producer aiming to remix it, accessing individual samples or stems is appealing but complicated by the era's production methods—heavy reliance on hardware samplers (e.g., Akai S1000, S950) and no widespread stem distribution practices at the time.

This survey compiles findings from extensive web searches, page browses, and analyses of production details. While no official high-quality stem packs were located (FSOL's Bandcamp and Discogs listings focus on full tracks and remixes), several unofficial resources and reconstruction strategies emerge. I'll break this down by availability, quality, methods to obtain elements, and practical tips for remixing, incorporating tables for clarity.

### Availability of Stems and Isolated Elements

Searches for terms like "Papua New Guinea FSOL stems download," "remix pack," "multitrack," and "acapella" yielded mostly remixes, full tracks, or discussions rather than direct stems. FSOL has reissued the track multiple times (e.g., on Bandcamp in 2023 with remixes by Andrew Weatherall and Graham Massey), but these are complete audio files, not separated components.

- **Unofficial Stems from Audioz.download**: A 2013 post offers "remix stems" as a free download. These are not professional multitracks but a 4MB collection of individual samples in 128kbps MP3 format. Users describe them as low-quality and "not proper song stems," suitable for basic editing in software like Audacity but potentially noisy or compressed. Download via http://peeplink.in/fc1d564bb233 (no payment required, though a LinkSnappy account might ease multi-host access). An additional link (http://peeplink.in/7931e64eb3ce) provides the original tracks FSOL sampled, aiding recreation. User feedback highlights usefulness for drum & bass remixes around 2004, with one mentioning a higher-quality version from a magazine CD (possibly Future Music) that could be uploaded uncompressed upon request.

- **Acapella (Stringsapella) from Acapellas4U**: A "stringsapella" version (likely isolating strings and vocals) is available in 128kbps MP3. It requires site registration for download, with previews and ad-free access unlocked via voluntary donation (no fixed price, but supports site maintenance). No user comments were found, but the site's focus on DJ tools suggests it's remix-oriented. File: future_sound_of_london_-_papua_new_guinea_(stringsapella).mp3. This could be ideal for vocal layering, given the track's prominent ethereal vocals.

- **Partial Isolations on Official Platforms**:  
  - Bandcamp's 2023 reissue includes "Papua New Guinea Dub Drums," a track isolating dub-style drums (paid download, 16-bit/44.1kHz FLAC or MP3, part of a 7-track album for around $7–10 based on similar releases). This isn't a raw sample but a remixed version, potentially extractable for loops.  
  - Other variants like the "Monsoon Mix" or "Dumb Child of Q Mix" emphasize certain elements (e.g., percussion or bass), available for purchase on Bandcamp or Discogs.

- **MIDI and Sequencing Resources**: A MIDI file for the full track is free or low-cost on Nonstop2k, useful for rebuilding melodies and structure in your DAW (e.g., Ableton or Logic). Chords (A, E, F#m, C#m) are documented on Chordify for guitar/keyboard recreation.

- **Forum Discussions (e.g., Dubstepforum)**: A 2014 thread asks for stems, but no direct links or uploads were provided—mostly speculation or offers to share personal recreations. No new leads emerged.

No paid premium packs (e.g., on Splice or Loopmasters) were found specifically for this track, likely due to its age and sample clearances.

### Production Details and Sample Sources

From a detailed Sound on Sound article (a "Classic Tracks" feature), the song was sequenced live using Atari 1040 software, Roland synths (JX3P, D110), and Akai samplers, with final compression via Fostex 3070 for a "radio-ready" sound. It took about a week to produce, emphasizing exotic, asynchronous layers. The track's sample-heavy nature makes recreation feasible—many elements are from identifiable sources.

**Table 1: Key Samples Used in "Papua New Guinea" (Sourced from WhoSampled and Sound on Sound)**

| Sample Element | Original Source | Description | How to Obtain |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Vocals (Ethereal female voice) | Dead Can Dance - "Dawn of the Iconoclast" (1987, from album *Within the Realm of a Dying Sun*) | Lisa Gerrard's haunting vocal, sampled from a cassette; pitched and layered for the main hook. | Stream/buy on Spotify, Bandcamp, or YouTube; extract via audio editor (e.g., free on Internet Archive). |
| Bassline | Meat Beat Manifesto - "Radio Babylon" (1990) | Pulsing, staccato bass driving the rhythm; sampled and looped. | Available on streaming platforms; full track downloadable from Bandcamp or Discogs vinyl rips. |
| Additional Vocals/Shelter Sample | Circuit feat. Koffi - "Shelter Me (Helter Skelter Mix)" (1989) | Vocal phrases and effects for texture. | Rare, but snippets on WhoSampled; search for full track on YouTube or vintage compilations. |
| Drums/Breaks | Various loops (e.g., sped-up James Brown-style breaks; Bobby Byrd - "Hot Pants" suggested in some analyses) | Layered from about four sources, including a fat bass drum; tribal percussion added. | Free breakbeat packs on sites like Freesound.org; original James Brown loops in public domain sample libraries. |
| Environmental/Effects | TV nature documentary on Papua New Guinea; seagull sounds, backwards whooshes, flute (pitched ±12), harp one-note sample. | Ambient layers for exotic feel; some recorded ad-hoc (e.g., mics capturing nearby rehearsals). | Recreate with stock libraries (e.g., free on BBC Sound Effects archive); flute/harp via synth plugins. |
| Other FX | Techno Grooves - "The Cry"; conga notes from TV/records; male session vocalist (unspecified). | Weird rhythms and static crackles for atmosphere. | Techno Grooves track on YouTube; general FX in free packs like Zero-G libraries (which ironically sample this track in reverse). |

These samples were manipulated creatively—e.g., gating strings, using Roland Space Echo for reverb. Total runtime emphasizes build-up, with no strict verse-chorus but evolving layers.

### Remixing Strategies and Tips

Given the scarcity of direct stems, focus on hybrid approaches:  

1. **Download and Clean Unofficial Files**: Use the Audioz stems as a base; import into your DAW, apply noise reduction (e.g., iZotope RX), and EQ to improve quality.  
2. **Rebuild from Samples**: Source the originals above (many free/streamable), then sample and process them to match FSOL's style—add compression, reverb, and pitch shifts. Tools like Sampler in Ableton are ideal.  
3. **Enhance with Modern Tools**: AI stem separators (e.g., free on Lalal.ai or paid on Moises) can isolate elements from the full track, though results vary for older productions. Combine with MIDI for synth recreations.  
4. **Explore Remixes for Inspiration**: Over 20 remixes exist (e.g., High Contrast, Bart Skils—free on SoundCloud/Hypeddit). Analyze them for isolated ideas, but don't directly sample without clearance.  
5. **Potential Costs**: Free options dominate, but Bandcamp purchases (~$1–2 per track) or donations (~$5–10) unlock better access. Total for a full setup: under $20.

**Table 2: Comparison of Resource Options**

| Resource Type | Quality | Cost | Ease of Access | Usefulness for Remix |
|---------------|---------|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Unofficial Stems (Audioz) | Low (128kbps MP3) | Free | Direct link; possible file host issues | Moderate—good for quick prototypes, but needs enhancement. |
| Stringsapella (Acapellas4U) | Low (128kbps MP3) | Free (with reg.); donation optional | Registration required; previews for donators | High for vocal remixes; layer over new beats. |
| Original Samples (e.g., Dead Can Dance track) | High (original masters) | Free/stream; $1–5 buy | Streaming sites or archives | High—authentic recreation, flexible for custom stems. |
| Bandcamp Dub Drums/Remixes | High (16-bit FLAC) | Paid (~$1–10) | Instant download | Moderate—isolated drums useful, but not full separation. |
| MIDI File (Nonstop2k) | N/A (sequencing) | Free/low-cost | Direct download | High for structure; pair with synths/samples. |

In summary, while direct high-quality stems elude public access, the track's transparent sample origins enable effective workarounds. This aligns with FSOL's experimental ethos—Cobain and Dougans often encouraged boundary-pushing. If these don't suffice, reaching out via FSOL's Bandcamp or socials might yield custom advice, though official stems seem unlikely.

## Conclusions

This research demonstrates the challenges and opportunities in modern sample archaeology. While the holy grail of official stems remains elusive, the detailed documentation of sample sources opens up creative possibilities for recreation and reinterpretation. 

The key finding is that "Papua New Guinea" works particularly well for this type of archaeological approach because FSOL were relatively transparent about their sampling practices, and many of the source materials remain accessible today.

## Future Research

- Investigation into other FSOL tracks with similar sample transparency
- Comparison of AI stem separation tools on 90s electronic tracks
- Analysis of how sample clearance practices from this era affect modern remix availability
