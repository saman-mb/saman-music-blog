# Live Looping with Octatrack

The Elektron Octatrack excels at real-time sampling and live looping, making it perfect for solo performances and live band situations. This guide covers essential techniques for capturing, manipulating, and performing with loops in real-time.

## Overview

Live looping on the Octatrack involves recording audio in real-time, then immediately playing it back while layering additional parts. The Octatrack's unique architecture allows for seamless transitions, complex loop manipulation, and dynamic performance control.

## What You'll Learn

- Real-time recording setup and techniques
- Loop synchronization and timing
- Crossfader control for smooth transitions
- Scene morphing for live manipulation
- Advanced pickup machine techniques

## Step 1: Initial Setup

### Input Configuration

1. **Connect Your Instrument**
   - Guitar/Bass: Use inputs 3-4 (unbalanced)
   - Synth/Keyboard: Use inputs 1-2 (balanced)
   - Microphone: Use inputs 3-4 with preamp

2. **Set Input Levels**
   - Press `[MIXER]`
   - Adjust `CUE` levels for monitoring
   - Set `GAIN` appropriately to avoid clipping

3. **Configure Recording Source**
   - Press `[REC SETUP]`
   - Select input source (IN12, IN34, or CUE)
   - Set recording format (16-bit for longer loops)

### Basic Project Setup

**Create New Project**
1. Press `[PROJECT]` + `[RECORD]`
2. Name your project
3. Set tempo if using sync
4. Save initial state

## Step 2: Pickup Machine Setup

### Configure Track 1 for Looping

1. **Select Pickup Machine**
   - Press `[TRACK 1]`
   - Hold `[RECORD]` + press `[PLAY]`
   - Navigate to machine type
   - Select `PICKUP`

2. **Set Loop Length**
   - Press `[REC SETUP]`
   - Set `RLEN` (Record Length)
   - For free-form: Set to maximum
   - For sync: Set to desired bars

3. **Recording Mode**
   - `NORM`: Standard overdubbing
   - `RTRG`: Retrigger on new recording
   - `THRU`: Direct passthrough

### Multiple Loop Tracks

**Setup Tracks 2-4**
- Repeat pickup machine setup
- Assign different input sources if needed
- Set varying loop lengths for layering

## Step 3: Basic Looping Technique

### First Loop Recording

1. **Prepare to Record**
   - Press `[REC]` on Track 1
   - Red light indicates record ready
   - Start playing your instrument

2. **Begin Recording**
   - Press `[PLAY]` while playing
   - Loop records automatically
   - Continue playing until desired length

3. **End Recording**
   - Press `[STOP]` to end recording
   - Loop immediately begins playback
   - Ready for overdubbing

### Overdubbing Layers

**Adding Parts**
1. Press `[REC]` again while loop plays
2. Play additional parts in time
3. Recording mixes with existing loop
4. Press `[STOP]` to stop overdubbing

**Managing Levels**
- Use `[LEVEL]` knob to balance overdubs
- Adjust input gain for consistency
- Use mixer for overall level control

## Step 4: Advanced Recording Techniques

### Sync vs. Free Recording

**Synchronized Recording**
- Set project tempo
- Use `RLEN` for exact bar lengths
- Perfect for rhythmic material
- Enables quantized starts

**Free Recording**
- Ignore tempo settings
- Record natural phrase lengths
- Better for ambient/organic material
- Use `FLEX` machines for time stretching

### Punch Recording

**Replace Sections**
1. Set playhead position
2. Press `[REC]` + `[PLAY]`
3. Record replacement section
4. Release to resume playback

**Selective Overdubbing**
- Use `[FUNC]` + `[REC]` for partial overdubs
- Target specific sections
- Maintain timing precision

## Step 5: Performance Control

### Crossfader Techniques

**A/B Scene Morphing**
1. **Setup Scene A**
   - Configure initial loop settings
   - Set filter, effects, levels
   - Save scene state

2. **Setup Scene B**
   - Modify parameters for variation
   - Change effects, pitch, filtering
   - Create contrasting sound

3. **Live Morphing**
   - Use crossfader to blend scenes
   - Create dynamic transitions
   - Automate parameter changes

### LFO Modulation

**Adding Movement**
1. **Assign LFOs**
   - Press `[LFO]`
   - Target filter frequency, level, or effects
   - Set appropriate speed and depth

2. **Performance LFOs**
   - Use fast LFOs for tremolo effects
   - Slow LFOs for evolving textures
   - Assign to `[LEVEL]` for auto-ducking

## Step 6: Multi-Track Looping

### Layered Loop Performance

**Track Organization**
- Track 1: Foundation (bass, rhythm)
- Track 2: Harmonic content (chords, pads)
- Track 3: Lead lines and solos
- Track 4: Percussion and textures

**Timing Coordination**
1. **Start with Foundation**
   - Record solid rhythmic base
   - Ensure tight timing
   - Set as reference for other tracks

2. **Layer Harmonics**
   - Sync to foundation track
   - Use complementary loop lengths
   - Build harmonic complexity

3. **Add Lead Elements**
   - Record melodic phrases
   - Use different loop lengths for variation
   - Create call-and-response patterns

### Advanced Sync Techniques

**Polyrhythmic Loops**
- Set different `RLEN` on each track
- Create complex rhythmic relationships
- Use master tempo for coordination

**Free-Form Layering**
- Disable sync on some tracks
- Create ambient textures
- Use `SLICE` mode for rhythmic variation

## Step 7: Live Performance Tips

### Preparation Strategies

**Pre-Performance Setup**
1. Create template project
2. Set up pickup machines
3. Configure crossfader scenes
4. Test all connections and levels

**Performance Planning**
- Plan loop order and progression
- Practice transitions between sections
- Prepare backup loops for safety

### Real-Time Techniques

**Smooth Transitions**
- Use `[FUNC]` + `[STOP]` for fade outs
- Master the timing of new loop starts
- Practice crossfader control

**Error Recovery**
- Keep multiple versions of important loops
- Use `[UNDO]` function when available
- Have backup material ready

**Dynamic Control**
- Use parts for instant muting/unmuting
- Assign quick access to key parameters
- Practice one-handed operation

## Step 8: Creative Applications

### Song Structure Building

**Verse/Chorus Sections**
1. Record verse loop foundation
2. Layer chorus elements on other tracks
3. Use parts to switch between sections
4. Create bridges with modified parameters

**Dynamic Arrangements**
- Build intensity through layering
- Use effects for textural changes
- Create breakdowns by removing layers

### Experimental Techniques

**Reverse Loops**
- Use `[FUNC]` + `[TRIG]` for reverse playback
- Create unique transitional effects
- Combine with forward loops for contrast

**Time Stretching**
- Use `FLEX` machines for tempo changes
- Create slow-motion or time-lapse effects
- Maintain pitch while changing speed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Timing Problems**
- Check sync settings
- Verify tempo accuracy
- Practice metronome awareness

**Level Management**
- Monitor input levels constantly
- Use compression for consistency
- Balance loop layers carefully

**Memory Management**
- Monitor available sample memory
- Use appropriate bit depth settings
- Clear unused samples regularly
